![screenshot](public/images/screenshot.png)

🔗 Live demo: https://housemates.hugolomba.com

**Housemates** is a full-stack web application designed to help people organise, manage and access everything in a shared house.
People living in shared houses often struggle to manage shared information.
This is usually scattered across messaging apps, making it hard to find, easy to forget and frustrating to manage.
Housemates solves this by centralising all shared-house information in one secure place.

It provides a protected space where house members can:

- manage bills and shared expenses
- track tasks and responsibilities
- create alerts with different priority levels
- store shared credentials
- invite new members using an invite code

### Running the Project

### Running the Database with Prisma

To set up and migrate your database schema, use Prisma commands:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database based on the Prisma schema.

To generate Prisma client after schema changes:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

You can also open Prisma Studio to browse your database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
